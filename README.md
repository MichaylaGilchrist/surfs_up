# Surfs_up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to view Oahu, Hawaii's temperature data to determine if a surf and ice cream shop would be a sustainable business year around.
## Results
A great way to see if surfing and ice cream eating would be desirable year around the temperatures for the months of June and December were compared. From viewing the summary statistics the following points stand out: 
1. The mean for June and December is fairly close, at 74.9 degrees F and 71.04 degrees F. Not too much to discourage surfing or ice cream consumption. 
2. The standard deviation between June and December is only 0.488 degrees. June has a SD of 3.257 degress F and December with 3.745 degrees F. Althought that seems like a small number it does produce a larger swing of temperatures in December. This could lead to some enough slightly colder days but not by much.
3. The lowest 25% of temperatures starts at 73 degrees F for June and 69 degrees F for December. This is close enough in temperature. 
## Summary
Overall, a surf and ice cream shop would be a great business to run all year long! There may be some colder weather in December but not enough to deter the true ice cream eating, wild wave riding believers.
